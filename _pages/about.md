The Streaming Random Patches (SRP) algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art ensemble methods for evolving data stream classification. Please contact me to have access to the preprint. 

[**Machine learning for streaming data: state of the art, challenges, and opportunities**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337581742_Machine_learning_for_streaming_data_state_of_the_art_challenges_and_opportunities)
H M Gomes, J Read, A Bifet, J P Barddal, J Gama
SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, ACM , 2019.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3373464.3373470
 
In this work, we focus on elucidating the connections among the current stateof- the-art on related fields; and clarifying open challenges in both academia and industry. You can obtain it in the ACM library or the pre-print in my research gate.
