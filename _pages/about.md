I am a Machine Learning Researcher and Data Scientist. 
As of 2022, I became a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in AI at the Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand). 
<!-- Previously, I am an associate researcher at the [AI Institute](https://ai.waikato.ac.nz) at the University of Waikato.  -->

### Gradient boosted trees for evolving data streams
N Gunasekara, B Pfahringer, H M Gomes, A Bifet. 
Machine Learning, Springer, 2024. [Access paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-024-06517-y)

Streaming Gradient Boosted Trees (SGBT) is trained using weighted squared loss elicited in XGBOOST. SGBT exploits trees with a replacement strategy to detect and recover from drifts, thus enabling the ensemble to adapt without sacrificing the predictive performance.

### Machine learning (in) security: A stream of problems
F Ceschin, M Botacin, A Bifet, B Pfahringer, L S Oliveira, H M Gomes, A Gregio
ACM Digital Threats: Research and Practice, 2024
[Access paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3617897)

We identify, detail, and discuss the main challenges in the correct application of Stream ML techniques to cybersecurity data. We evaluate how concept drift, evolution, delayed labels, and adversarial ML impact the existing solutions. 

### A Survey on Semi-Supervised Learning for Delayed Partially Labelled Data Streams
H M Gomes, M Grzenda, R Mello, J Read, M H L Nguyen, A Bifet. ACM Computing Surveys, 2022.
DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3523055](https://doi.org/10.1145/3523055)

We organise methods that leverage unlabelled data in a semi-supervised setting for streaming data. We also discuss the delayed labelling issue, which impacts both fully supervised and semi-supervised methods.

### Streaming Random Patches for Evolving Data Stream Classification
H M Gomes, J Read, A Bifet. IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), 2019. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2019.00034](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2019.00034)

The Streaming Random Patches (SRP) algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art ensemble methods for evolving data stream classification. [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338943432_Streaming_Random_Patches_for_Evolving_Data_Stream_Classification)

### Machine learning for streaming data: state of the art, challenges, and opportunities
H M Gomes, J Read, A Bifet, J P Barddal, J Gama. SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, ACM , 2019. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3373464.3373470](https://doi.org/10.1145/3373464.3373470)
 
In this work, we focus on elucidating the connections among the current stateof-the-art on related fields; and clarifying open challenges in both academia and industry.

### A Survey on Ensemble Learning for Data Stream Classification
H M Gomes, J P Barddal, F Enembreck, A Bifet. ACM Computing Surveys 50, 2, Article 23, 2017. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3054925](https://doi.org/10.1145/3054925)
 
This paper contains the most up to date and comprehensive survey about ensemble learning for data streams.  [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315698712_A_Survey_on_Ensemble_Learning_for_Data_Stream_Classification)

### Adaptive random forests for evolving data stream classiÔ¨Åcation
H M Gomes, A Bifet, J Read, ..., B Pfahringer, G Holmes, T Abdessalem. Machine Learning, Springer, 2017. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-017-5642-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-017-5642-8)
 
This paper presents an efficent version of the classical Random Forests algorithm for evolving data streams, namely the Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) algorithm. [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317579226_Adaptive_random_forests_for_evolving_data_stream_classification)
