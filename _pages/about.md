I am a Machine Learning Researcher and Data Scientist. 
As of 2022, I became a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in AI at the Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand). 
<!-- Previously, I am an associate researcher at the [AI Institute](https://ai.waikato.ac.nz) at the University of Waikato.  -->

### A Survey on Semi-Supervised Learning for Delayed Partially Labelled Data Streams
H M Gomes, M Grzenda, R Mello, J Read, M H L Nguyen, A Bifet. ACM Computing Surveys, 2022.
DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3523055](https://doi.org/10.1145/3523055)

We organise methods that leverage unlabelled data in a semi-supervised setting for streaming data. We also discuss the delayed labelling issue, which impacts both fully supervised and semi-supervised methods.

### Streaming Random Patches for Evolving Data Stream Classification
H M Gomes, J Read, A Bifet. IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), 2019. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2019.00034](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2019.00034)

The Streaming Random Patches (SRP) algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art ensemble methods for evolving data stream classification. [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338943432_Streaming_Random_Patches_for_Evolving_Data_Stream_Classification)

### Machine learning for streaming data: state of the art, challenges, and opportunities
H M Gomes, J Read, A Bifet, J P Barddal, J Gama. SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, ACM , 2019. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3373464.3373470](https://doi.org/10.1145/3373464.3373470)
 
In this work, we focus on elucidating the connections among the current stateof-the-art on related fields; and clarifying open challenges in both academia and industry.

### A Survey on Ensemble Learning for Data Stream Classification
H M Gomes, J P Barddal, F Enembreck, A Bifet. ACM Computing Surveys 50, 2, Article 23, 2017. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3054925](https://doi.org/10.1145/3054925)
 
This paper contains the most up to date and comprehensive survey about ensemble learning for data streams.  [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315698712_A_Survey_on_Ensemble_Learning_for_Data_Stream_Classification)

### Adaptive random forests for evolving data stream classiÔ¨Åcation
H M Gomes, A Bifet, J Read, ..., B Pfahringer, G Holmes, T Abdessalem. ACM Machine Learning, Springer, 2017. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-017-5642-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-017-5642-8)
 
This paper presents an efficent version of the classical Random Forests algorithm for evolving data streams, namely the Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) algorithm. [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317579226_Adaptive_random_forests_for_evolving_data_stream_classification)
