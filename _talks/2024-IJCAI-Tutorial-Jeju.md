The field of Machine Learning for Data Streams has seen growing interest and adoption in recent years, particularly in industry. Despite this progress, there remains a noticeable gap between cutting-edge research and the practical tools available, making it difficult for even experienced data scientists to apply and evaluate these techniques in real-world scenarios. Our tutorial is designed to address this issue by focusing on two key areas. We explore advanced topics, such as handling streams with partially delayed labels, while providing practical, Python-based demonstrations for implementation and evaluation. This dual approach aims to empower both researchers and practitioners to develop new experiments and extend current methodologies.
