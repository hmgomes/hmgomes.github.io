Machine Learning for Data Streams (MLDS) has been an important area of research since the late 1990s, and its usage in industry has grown significantly over the last few years. However, there is still a gap between the cutting-edge research and the tools that are readily available, which makes it challenging for practitioners, including experienced data scientists, to implement and evaluate these methods in this highly complex domain. Our tutorial aims to bridge this gap with a dual focus. We discuss advanced research topics, such as partially delayed labeled streams, while providing practical demonstrations of their implementation and assessment using Python. By catering to both researchers and practitioners, the tutorial aims to empower them to design and conduct experiments, and extend existing methodologies.
