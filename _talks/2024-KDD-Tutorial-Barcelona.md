Our tutorial aims to bridge this gap with a dual focus. We discuss important research topics, such as partially delayed labeled streams, while providing practical demonstrations of their implementation and assessment using CapyMOA, an open-source library that provides efficient algorithm implementations through a high-level Python API. This tutorial also included exercises and many examples.
