## 3rd ECML/PKDD 2018 Workshop and Tutorial on IoT Large Scale Machine Learning from Data Streams

The volume of data is rapidly increasing due to the development of the technology of information and communication. This data comes mostly in the form of streams. Learning from this ever-growing amount of data requires flexible learning models that self-adapt over time. In addition, these models must take into account many constraints: (pseudo) real-time processing, high-velocity, and dynamic multi-form change such as concept drift and novelty. The tutorial was combined with a workshop on the same topic.
